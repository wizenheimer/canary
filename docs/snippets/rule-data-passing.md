- Browser state persists across steps: named pages (and their cookies) stay open between scripts
  within a session — reuse the same page name so each step picks up where the last left off.
- Anonymous `newPage()` tabs are closed when each script ends.
- To pass values between steps: `writeFile("state.json", JSON.stringify(x))` in one step,
  `JSON.parse(await readFile("state.json"))` in the next.
