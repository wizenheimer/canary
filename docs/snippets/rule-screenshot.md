After each `{{cli}} run --step`, the daemon auto-captures ONE screenshot of the step's
last-opened tab and binds it to that step in the report. So:

- Keep one primary named page per step — the report screenshot is always the page you mean.
- If a step opens several tabs, open the one you want featured last.
- `saveScreenshot(...)` images land in `~/.canary/tmp/` and are NOT in the report — they're
  extras for debugging.
